# Ferrum Oxidize

_This was my first attempt at a build tool for Ferrum. I learned a lot from this, but the fundamental structure of the code needed to change, and my mindset for the build tool eventually shifted._

This repo has now been archived.
- The CLI tool for working with Ferrum lives at [ferrum-lang/ferrum](https://github.com/ferrum-lang/ferrum)
- The dependency that implements the build process lives at [ferrum-lang/ferrum_compiler](https://github.com/ferrum-lang/ferrum_compiler)
